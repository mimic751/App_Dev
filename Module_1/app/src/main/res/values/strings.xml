       Journal activities in this course are private between you and the instructor. The project journals in this course are meant to help you complete Final Project Part I and Final Project Part II.

For this assignment, you will access the Android Studio and Java SDK through SNHUâ€™s virtual desktop (VDI). Follow these instructions to access the VDI.

Once the development environment configuration is complete, follow the Build Your First App tutorial in the module reading and resources and modify the Hello World text to your name. Then, review the Final Project Part I and Part II Guidelines and Rubric documents and the Mobile Application Framework document.

In your journal, detail the following:

Screenshot of your modified Hello World App
Any challenges you faced during the installation and configuration and how you overcame those challenges
The functionality set you selected for the final project, including your justification for choosing that particular functionality set
